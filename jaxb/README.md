Cyc JAXB Projects
-----------------

This directory contains JAXB projects to facilitate XML processing in Java.

Note that these JAXB projects are self-contained, including their own copies of the XML Schema (xsd)
files. However, the canonical version of those schemas live under the sibling `xsd` directory.
